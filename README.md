# shift-light
This repository contains code for a Miata shift light, 
using a generic WS2812 individually addressible LED strip and ATTiny85 microcontroller.

## CAD Files
The ```cad/``` directory contains files generated in KiCAD for the PCB layout. 
The included Gerber files should be useful in manufacturing this (as-yet-untested) board.
